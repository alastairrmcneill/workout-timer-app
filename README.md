# Workout Timer App

When it comes to timed workouts, I find them annoying. If I do a jump rope workout, I don't want to have to keep looking at my timer, remember what time I started at, or stop skipping to reset the timer. I want to be able to program in all the exercises and the timer will count down through them all. This is what I've made with this Workout Timer app.

## Technology

This project is made using Dart and the Flutter framework. SQLite was used to store the workouts and activities for next time.
